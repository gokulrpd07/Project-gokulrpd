Project-gokulrpd: ICLeaf Capstone Project

Overview
--------
This capstone project consists of four major tasks that collectively demonstrate the design, development, and querying of a robust Academic Management System and an Event Registration Application using SQL and PostgreSQL. The project also includes performing OLAP operations on sales data to extract actionable business insights.

Task 1 - Academic Management System Design
------------------------------------------
Objective:
Design and develop a basic Academic Management System involving the following three key tables:
- StudentInfo: Stores student personal and academic details.
- CoursesInfo: Contains details of the courses offered.
- EnrollmentInfo: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.

Outcome:
A relational schema that manages student-course relationships and supports CRUD operations and reporting.

Task 2 - Student Database Management (PostgreSQL)
-------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Implement a Student Database Management System using PostgreSQL to:
- Efficiently store, update, and retrieve student data.
- Ensure data normalization, indexing, and performance optimization.

Outcome:
A scalable and normalized student database with relevant constraints and optimized queries for performance.

Task 3 - Event Management Application
------------------------------------
Objective:
Develop a database-backed application that supports:
- Creation and management of events.
- Registration and tracking of attendees.
- Efficient handling of event logistics through database design.

Outcome:
A functioning event management database system with the ability to track participation and logistics effectively.

Task 4 - OLAP Operations and Sales Data Analysis
------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Use OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) techniques such as Roll-up, Drill-down, Cube, and Aggregation to analyze sales data.

Features:
- Multi-dimensional analysis of sales data.
- Querying across different dimensions (time, product, region).
- Advanced filtering and grouping to uncover trends and patterns.

Outcome:
A collection of OLAP-based SQL queries that help in understanding the business performance across various metrics and dimensions.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
